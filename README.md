- Goal: Use OpenStates.org API to keep track of all drone-related laws across all 50 states

- Ideally, run program =>
- Program makes API call to OpenStates.org, searches all 50 states for laws
  with the keywords "drone", "drones", or "unmanned" =>
- Returns JSON data of all relevant bills & their info =>
- Saves data to a spreadsheet? Or a Database? =>
- Checks updated data against previous data, alerts me to any new bills or updates

- Pie in the sky: somehow integrate directly into WordPress
